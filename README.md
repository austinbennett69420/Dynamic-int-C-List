# Dynamic-int-C-List
A dynamic int list library, although it could be used in larger projects it is mostly 
meant just to help beginners start coding in C, or for relatively small projects, applications where memory usage 
is critical should not use this library as I like my buffers!
# How to install
If your using GCC or mingw on windows i know 
you can locate the "include" path by going  to 
C:/llvm-mingw-20231128-ucrt-x86_64(or whatever gcc library you use)/include
then install the dynamicListIntegers.h file to their (copy paste)
# Documentation
i included a example file (example.c) detailing all the functions
and their uses, you can read through that, or email me:
(theaustinbennett@gmail.com) for questions
# Future
if this ends up being popular i will make dynamic list librarys for bool, 
floats, and other types in C aswell!
